# Binary Tree 

This project creates methods to (1) build a binary tree data structure from some arbitrary input array, (2) perform a breadth-first search, and (3) perform a depth-first search. 

A [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) is a type of ordered or sorted [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree); before modern computer science terminology, binary trees were called **bifurcating arborescence**, which is clearly the far superior term.
